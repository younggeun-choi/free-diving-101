      "content": "Frenzel Equalizing is a technique where you close the glottis and push air to the middle ear using the tongue. It is primarily used for deep diving in head-first position."

    "principle": {
      "title": "Principle of Frenzel",
      "content": "Frenzel works through the coordination of three main muscles",
      "glottis": "Glottis: Closes the airway to the lungs to prevent air from escaping, while maintaining a relaxed state without tension in the neck.",
      "softPalate": "Soft Palate: Keeps the airway to the nose open so air can be delivered to the middle ear (Eustachian tube).",
      "tongue": "Tongue: Acts as a piston, pushing air upward through the mouth to deliver it to the middle ear via the Eustachian tube."

      "step1": "Take a deep breath through your mouth and hold it.",
      "step2": "Feel the sensation of your throat locking.",
      "step3": "Touch your neck with your hand to ensure it doesn't expand.",
      "step4": "Try to exhale through your nose while holding your breath. (Success if no air moves)",
      "step5": "Make an \"ahh\" sound while alternating between opening/closing 10 times.",
      "success": "Breath is held, neck is relaxed, and no air sound."

      "title": "Advanced Glottis Control",
      "goal": "Consciously control opening and closing of the glottis.",
      "step1": "Breathe in through your mouth and close the glottis.",
      "step2": "Hold for 5 seconds then open with \"ahh\".",
      "step3": "Practice alternating closed ↔ open to learn the difference.",
      "step4": "Ensure only the glottis works without neck tension.",

      "step2": "Breathe only through your mouth → closed.",
      "step3": "Make an \"ng\" sound and check if you feel nasal vibration.",
      "step4": "If vibration disappears when nose is blocked with \"ng\" sound, it's closed.",
      "success": "Feel the passage behind the nose 'opening' when open."

    "day4": {
      "title": "Advanced Soft Palate Control",
      "goal": "Freely switch between opening and closing the soft palate.",
      "step1": "Alternate \"ng\" ↔ \"ah\" vocalization.",
      "step2": "Mimic yawning and learn the sensation of widening the nasal passage.",
